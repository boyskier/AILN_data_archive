Tendon\n\ndermatitis is the last clinical feature of the DGI triad, and it typically presents as hemorrhagic papules and pustules. Despite common knowledge that gonorrhea is an STI, it doesn\u0027t exclusively affect sexually active adults. If a pregnant person has an untreated gonococcal infection, they can pass the infection onto the baby during delivery.

            <h2>Full Text</h2>
            <div id="originalText">﻿Welcome back to our film noir series we've saved the best for last Niceria Ganaria.
In this scene, we'll join our protagonist defeated.
She heads to the old watering hole Gonzo's bar to drown her sorrows chin up.
Perhaps all is not lost. What's lost may be found.
Well, we can spot a good foreshadow when we see one.
Can you spot a Niceria bug when you see it?
Nisseria are gram negative diplococci

for the other common features of the Nisseria genus, start back at part one.
The only feature that will make you extra remember here is that NSYIA is facultative intracellular hence the two red cherries in the mixed drink specifically their facultative intracellular and Pmn's or polymorphonucleated white blood cells.
So if you see a slide with gram negative diplococci inside a Pmn, think Niceria gana riai.
One other feature is that unlike meningitidis, Niseria gonorrheae is not encapsulated.

Recall that in the Ncyia meningitida sketch, we had the liquor capsule to symbolize men in jacoccal capsules.
Here we've placed this obviously broken glass capsule here to remind you that Niceria Ganariai does not have a capsule.
The next thing we'll cover is something you probably already know.
Gonorrhea is a reportable sexually transmitted infection.
So we've added a little intimate moment between Mac and her lost flame.

HA, HA, that's the lost flame like enmeningitidis and gonorrhea can develop in asymptomatic carriers.
So we've got these care free folks here.
Due to anatomical differences, the male genitalia is far more likely to harbor the bug without causing any symptoms.
Also, newborns can pick up the bacteria by direct contact when passing through the vaginal canal during labor and delivery, which can cause a severe eye infection and blindness.
But we'll get to that shortly.

Okay so now let's move on to cover the clinical features of gonorrhea.
The siria gonorrheae is an STI and as such, the first place it most commonly infects is the genitalia When symptoms are seen in those with male reproductive organs, they can present as urethritis, prostatitis and epididymitis.
Urethritis often has no presenting symptoms.
You may get a hunch only by the presence of white blood cells on your analysis hence the leaky tap.
This is called pyuria without dysuria.

As an interesting side note, you may recall the virulence factor OPA turns out bacteria that cause asymptomatic infections express different opa proteins from bacteria that cause symptomatic and more severe infection.
Neat. Did anyone order the flaming milk bomb?
Let this inflammatory drink remind you of urethritis with symptoms Symptomatic inflammation of the urethra can present with painful urination, ie dysuria and a mucopurulent or milky urethral discharge.

If engonorrheae travels further up the male genital urinary tract, it can cause prostatitis represented by the apple seat cushion and epididymitis orchitis represented by the orchid.
So think of angonorrheae in a young sexually active person presenting with either dysuria and prostate tenderness or testicular pain and swelling.
And that's it for the male reproductive infections.
Infections in people with female reproductive organs include urethritis, cervicitis and PID but

the female reproductive anatomy is slightly more complicated so we'll go through each of these in some detail.
We're going to illustrate the clinical manifestations of a urogenital gonococcal infection in those with female reproductive organs with this chandelier and you'll notice it looks a lot like a uterus with fallopian tubes and ovaries.
We'll start with the more distal sites of infection and work our way up.
Let's start with the neck of the chandelier, which will represent the cervix.

In people with a cervix, the primary site of infection is the endocervix, which can further extend to the urethra and vagina.
Servositis is more commonly asymptomatic, but its classic symptoms include mucopurulent discharge or postquital spotting that occurs outside of normal menstruation

Intermenstral bleeding such as postcoidal spotting is an alarming symptom, and this will usually get the patient to go see their doctor.
Since gonococcal infections of the endocervix and urethra often don't present with symptoms treatment isn't sought and end gonorrhea can travel to the pelvic region and cause pelvic inflammatory disease or Pid.
Symptoms of PID like abdominal pain, abnormal vaginal bleeding and dysperunia can be the first presenting complaints of a gonococcal infection.

Piety can further progress to the fallopian tubes and cause salpinggitis.
Interestingly, bacterial lipo oligosaccharide is a major virulence factor in the development of severe salpinggitis.
Sapingitis can lead to even worse complications like ectopic pregnancy and infertility.
A further complication of PID is the spread of infection to the liver and peritoneum.
When this happens, it's referred to as Fitz Hugh Curtis syndrome cleverly symbolized by our house band the Fitz Hugh and Curtis trio.

This inflammation of the peritoneum can lead to adhesions that stick to the capsule of the liver.
These long and thin string like adhesions are commonly referred to as violin string adhesions.
DGI or disseminated gonococcal infection occurs in patients with male or female reproductive anatomy usually following an asymptomatic eurogenital infection Nassiria ganoriae can colonize the snovial fluid causing purulent arthritis hence the cracked piano lec here.

Interestingly, Sanovo fluid cultures are falsely negative more than half of the time and alone are not enough to diagnose a joint infection.
In addition to septic joints, a disseminated gonococcal infection can present as a triad of polyarthralgia, tenosinovitis and dermatitis.
Polyarthralgia can involve the knees, ankles and wrists.
Tenosynovitis commonly affects the tendons in the wrist or the achilles.
Tendon

dermatitis is the last clinical feature of the DGI triad, and it typically presents as hemorrhagic papules and pustules.
Despite common knowledge that gonorrhea is an STI, it doesn't exclusively affect sexually active adults.
If a pregnant person has an untreated gonococcal infection, they can pass the infection onto the baby during delivery.
This can manifest as apirulent conjunctivitis AKA opthalmia neonatorum, which typically presents within the first five days of life.

Viruses and other bacteria such as chlamydia can cause this.
In contrast to early gonococcal eye infection in the newborn, chlamydia usually presents later about five to 14 days after birth.
Of course, we can prevent this infection by applying some arthromice anointment to the baby's eyes.
Now that you know the ways a gonococcal infection can present, let's briefly cover diagnosis.

A urine urethral endocervical specimen can be gram stained and cultured, but the test of choice is nucleic acid amplification testing or NAT because of its high sensitivity and production of rapid results.
Hence we've thrown some Nats into the scene onto treatment.
The therapy of choice for gonorrhea is a single intramuscular dose of ceftriaxone represented by our recurring three axs symbol.

Although ceftriaxone is all you need to successfully treat gonorrhea If a question asked what you'd prescribe for a gonococcal infection and you selected ceftriaxone only, you'd get the answer wrong.
This is because patients with gonorrhea are very likely to have a chlamydia co infection.
For the right answer, take a look at this wall art featuring three recurring sketchy symbols, clam lady, a cyclist and a crow.
Ah, the art of medicine.

So when you start a patient on treatment for a gonococcal infection, you assume they have a CO infection and treat them for chlamydia as well with either doxycycline or amacrylide like azithromycin.
Lastly, since gonorrhea is a sexually transmitted infection, counsel your patients on barrier methods such as consistent condom use with engonorrheae There is no long lasting immunity because Nesyia exhibits such a wide degree of variation in their surface antigens.

So having the infection once doesn't prevent one from getting it again and again and again.
Prevention is key and that's a wrap on our film noir series and on Nisseria we hope you've enjoyed this cinematic masterpiece and remember to clean up your popcorn and candy.
No one likes the sticky Floor Tata.
